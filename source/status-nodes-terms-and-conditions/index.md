By submitting your entry, you agree that it conforms to these Official Rules, including the Guidelines and Restrictions below, and that Status may disqualify you from the Contest if Status believes, in our sole discretion, that your entry fails to conform to these Official Rules.

If you’re accepted for the Contest, you’ll be contacted by Status via the Status App. You’re the sole person responsible for providing correct contact information; Status won’t be responsible if you provide incorrect or incomplete contact information.

2. Phase 2 - If you’re chosen to participate in the Contest, you can win the prize by completing this challenge:

    - First: Launch your Status node by:
        a) Join the “Node Runner” intro call or watch the recorded tutorial on how to set up your node

        b) Join the #status-node-runners channel for support.

    - Next: Share your “enode” identifier with Status via the Status App so we can validate that you have launched your own Status node (the “Individual Node”). The Individual Node start date begins on the date when Status has confirmed to you (via the Status App) that the Individual Node is active. 

    - Last: You must maintain the active Individual Node for at least three (3) months constantly (from the Individual Node start date) and on an uninterrupted basis.

<br>

### Winner Determination: 

If you complete the challenge by keeping the Individual Node active for three (3) months from the Individual Node start date, you’ll be a winner eligible for the prize.

### Prize: 

USD $100 in Status Network Tokens (“SNT”)
